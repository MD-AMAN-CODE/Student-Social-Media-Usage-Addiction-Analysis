🔹 Project Description (LinkedIn Post – Based on YOUR DATA)
🚀 Excel Data Analysis Project | Student Social Media Dashboard

I analyzed a dataset of 700+ students to understand how social media usage patterns affect academic performance, sleep, mental health, and addiction levels.
🔍 Dataset Covered:
-Average Daily Social Media Usage (Hours)
-Most Used Platforms (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc.)
-Sleep Hours per Night
-Mental Health Score
-Academic Performance Impact
-Social Media Addiction Score & Levels

📊 What I Did in Excel:
✔ Cleaned and structured raw student data
✔ Created KPIs to classify addiction levels
✔ Used Pivot Tables for multi-dimensional analysis
✔ Built interactive charts & dashboards
✔ Extracted behavioral and lifestyle insights

💡 Key Insights from Analysis:
-Students with higher daily social media usage (5+ hrs) show higher addiction scores
-Highly addicted students tend to have lower sleep hours (≤6 hrs)
-Excessive social media usage is strongly linked with negative academic impact
-Moderate usage shows better mental health balance compared to extreme usage
📌 This project helped me strengthen my Excel analytics, KPI building, and data storytelling skills by converting raw data into actionable insights.
